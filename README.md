# umtech_f1

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Got it! Since this is for a **Technothon competition**, we need to make the README **polished, compelling, and competition-ready**—highlighting innovation, impact, and feasibility. Here's an **optimized README** that balances **technical depth** with a **strong pitch** for judges and evaluators.

# 🚀 Predictive Disaster Insight and Response System  

## 🎯 **Overview**  
🌍 **A next-gen disaster intelligence system** that predicts and mitigates risks **before they happen**.  
🔍 **Combining AI, IoT, and real-time data**, this system provides **early warnings** for floods and fires, enabling **proactive disaster response**.  

### 🔥 **Why It Matters?**  
✅ **Saves lives** – Early alerts for evacuation & safety measures  
✅ **Minimizes damage** – Predicts high-risk zones before disaster strikes  
✅ **Low-cost & scalable** – Uses **minimal hardware** for **maximum impact**  

---

## 🛠️ **System Architecture**  
### 🔹 **1. Smart Sensor Nodes** *(Minimal but Powerful)*  
We deploy **1-2 smart nodes** to **validate predictions** with real-world data.  

| Component | Purpose | Notes |  
|-----------|---------|-------|  
| **ESP32** | Controller + Wi-Fi | Low-power & cloud-friendly |  
| **Ultrasonic Sensor** | Water level detection | Flood detection |  
| **MQ-2 / Flame Sensor** | Fire risk indicator | Detects temperature/smoke |  
| **DHT22** | Temp & humidity | Predictive input |  
| **Rain Sensor** *(Optional)* | Surface flooding insight | Adds extra accuracy |  

💡 **Key Innovation:** Hardware is **not** for deployment—it's for **validating AI predictions**.  

---

### 🔹 **2. AI-Powered Prediction Model**  
**Machine Learning (Python)** predicts disaster risks using **real-time + historical data fusion**.  

✅ **Flood Prediction** – Based on **rainfall, humidity, rising water, soil moisture**  
✅ **Fire Risk Prediction** – Based on **heat, dry air, gas levels, past fire data**  
✅ **Validation** – AI predictions are **cross-checked** with real sensor inputs  

💡 **Tech Stack:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LSTM *(if time allows)*  

---

### 🔹 **3. Central Web Dashboard**  
A **real-time, interactive dashboard** for monitoring **live sensor data + AI predictions**.  

✅ **Google Maps / Leaflet.js** – Visualizes risk zones  
✅ **Firebase / Node.js** – Syncs real-time sensor data  
✅ **Features:**  
- **Live sensor feed** (status indicators)  
- **Risk prediction heatmaps** (fire/flood probability)  
- **Alert system** (Risk Level: Green/Yellow/Red)  
- **Historical comparison graphs**  
- **AI Chatbot** (voice recognition & multilingual support)  
- **SOS Alerts**  
- **Danger & Safety place Map**  

💡 **Key Differentiator:** **Predictive AI + Actionable Insights** (*“Flood likely in Zone A in next 3 hours”*)  

---

## 💡 **Market Differentiation**  
🚀 **Unlike traditional disaster monitoring systems**, this project goes beyond simple data collection:  

| Traditional Systems | Our System |  
|--------------------|------------|  
| Just collects sensor data | **Predicts disasters before they happen** |  
| No AI-based forecasting | **Machine learning-driven risk analysis** |  
| No multi-source fusion | **Combines real-time, historical & API data** |  
| Requires large-scale deployment | **Only 1 sensor node needed for validation** |  

---

## 🧪 **Demo Plan** *(Technothon Showcase)*  
1️⃣ **Flood Test** – Sensor node in a bowl of water with adjustable levels  
2️⃣ **External Weather Data** – Shows increasing rainfall  
3️⃣ **Prediction Model** – Warns *“Flood risk high in next 30 minutes”*  
4️⃣ **Dashboard Visualization** – Displays data + alert  

💡 **Impact:** Judges can **see real-time predictions** working with **live sensor validation**.  

---

## 🚀 **Getting Started**  
### 🔹 **Prerequisites**  
- **Hardware**: ESP32, sensors (Ultrasonic, MQ-2, DHT22)  
- **Software**: Python, Firebase, React.js, Node.js  
- **APIs**: OpenWeatherMap, public disaster reports
